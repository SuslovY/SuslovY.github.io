I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Stat](https://math.lzu.edu.cn/), [Lanzhou University](https://www.lzu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes statistical machine learning, deep learning, convex optimization, and financial Mathematics.
I am very fortunate to be advised by [Zhengtao Gui](https://www.XXX.com/) of XXX Lab from [School of Stat](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/), University of Science and Technology of China. I was advised by [Prof. Yuan](https://XXX.pku.edu.cn/) from [School of Mathematics](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), The Hongkong Polytechnic University.


A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
